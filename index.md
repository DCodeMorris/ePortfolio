## **Artifact 1 Software Engineering and Design**
### Introduction:

The artifact I have chosen for Enhancement One: Software Design and Engineering is a 2D rendering vector of triangles. I designed and built the 2D rendering using Visual Studio, an integrated development environment (IDE). To create the 2D rendering using this environment, I incorporated OpenGL, an application programming interface (API). OpenGL requires a programming language to operate; I have chosen to use my language of choice, C++.  

My artifact was created during CS-330 Computer Graphics and Visualization class, which took place in May of 2022 during my 22EW5 term at SNHU. I determined this was the best project to enhance because I know OpenGL is a widely used API that has been around for a long time and is still used in top businesses and supported by current hardware. With most of the world still using OpenGL, I will have a larger pool of opportunities with my knowledge and skills, enhancing my artifact.  

I showcase an impressive amount of my abilities using C++ programming language with the OpenGL API. To enhance this artifact, I transformed my rendering of a 2D object into a 3D pyramid, and I did this because as time goes on, we are introduced with new technology and more powerful hardware that really push graphics to new levels, and when this happens, the desire for realism increases.

## **Artifact 2 Algorithms and Data Structures**
### Introduction:

The artifact I have chosen for Enhancement Two: Algorithms and Data Structure is enhancing the search algorithm of my Python application that handles data about pets in animal shelters.  To enhance the search algorithm, I utilized the development environment PyCharm.  My application is written using Python, which is a high-level programming language.  I decided to use this application due to its large number of algorithms and programming logic already created.  I originally created this application during the 22EW4 term in class CS-340 Client/Server Development.

I determined this was the best project to enhance stemmed from how popular Python’s programming language is, ranking as the 4th most popular language according to a 2021 Overflow survey.  Python’s widespread use in web and game development, areas where I excel.  Along with its prevalence in emerging fields like machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) solidified my decision.  With the recent influx of AI and machine learning happening around the world, joining a team in either domain could have potential contributions to groundbreaking innovations in the future.

## **Artifact 3 Databases**
### Introduction:

The artifact for Enhancement Three: Databases is a Python application designed to create a web interface using the Dash web app framework and integrating Dash Component modules for displaying animal data from animal shelters, including results that are filtered based on user criteria.  This application was developed during my CS-340 Client/Server Development course in the 22EW4 term.  These applications originated in my second artifact, where I developed an enhanced search algorithm.  Choosing PyCharm as my development environment (IDE) and using the Python programming language, I designed and developed a useful enhancement to this application, I accomplished this by implementing an additional collection, “users” into my database to handle user accounts. My goal is to align my work with all-course outcomes related to databases.
